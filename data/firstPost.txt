#WooHoo!

##I finally have put together version 1.0 of [quicBlog].

This application is designed for those who are tired of writing a nice simple blog post and realizing they need to add links.

It will automatically generate **`href="#"`** tags for anything enclosed by square brackets ex: **`[hello]`**. after your done you then add the actual reference at the bottom of the text page.

###Example:

+ **`[hello]: http://hello.com`**

###Directions:

+ To use this [application] download it.
+ Install on your server.
+ Run **`quicBlog.php`** from local host.
+ When done change **Preview** to **HTML Output**
+ Copy and Paste
